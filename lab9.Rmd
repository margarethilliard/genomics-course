# Matching patterns with regular expressions

```{r include=FALSE}
library(stringr)
library(tidyverse)
```

##  Basic matches

The simplest patterns match exact strings:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "an")
```

The next step up in complexity is ., which matches any character (except a newline):
```{r}
str_view(x, ".a.")
```

Note that this only shows the first match in a string.
But if “.” matches any character, how do you match the character “.”? You need to use an “escape” to tell the regular expression you want to match it exactly, not use its special behaviour. Like strings, regexps use the backslash, \, to escape special behaviour. So to match an ., you need the regexp \.. Unfortunately this creates a problem. We use strings to represent regular expressions, and \ is also used as an escape symbol in strings. So to create the regular expression \. we need the string "\\.".

```{r}
# To create the regular expression, we need \\
dot <- "\\."

# But the expression itself only contains one:
writeLines(dot)
```
```{r}
# And this tells R to look for an explicit .
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "bef")
str_view(x, "a\\.c")
```
If \is used as an escape character in regular expressions, how do you match a literal \? Well you need to escape it, creating the regular expression \\. To create that regular expression, you need to use a string, which also needs to escape \. That means to match a literal \ you need to write "\\\\" — you need four backslashes to match one!
```{r}
x <- "a\\b"
writeLines(x)
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "\\\\")
```
In this book, I’ll write regular expression as . and strings that represent the regular expression as "\\.".

### Exercise

Explain why each of these strings don’t match a \: "\", "\\", "\\\"

    The strings don't match a \ because the first \ in an expression is an “escape” and not what you're searching for. 

## Anchors

By default, regular expressions will match any part of a string. It’s often useful to anchor the regular expression so that it matches from the start or end of the string. You can use:

    ^ to match the start of the string.
    $ to match the end of the string.
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_view(x, "^a") #matches with anything with an a at the beginning of the string
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "a$") #matches with anything with an a at the end of the string
```

To remember which is which, try this mnemonic which I learned from Evan Misshula: if you begin with power (^), you end up with money ($).

To force a regular expression to only match a complete string, anchor it with both ^ and $:
```{r}
x <- c("apple pie", "apple", "apple cake")
str_view(x, "apple")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "^apple$") #begins and ends with apple
```
You can also match the boundary between words with \b. I don’t often use this in R, but I will sometimes use it when I’m doing a search in RStudio when I want to find the name of a function that’s a component of other functions. For example, I’ll search for \bsum\b to avoid matching summarise, summary, rowsum and so on.

### Exercise

How would you match the literal string "$^$"?

```{r}
str_view(c("$^$", "ab$^$sfas"), "^\\$\\^\\$$", match = TRUE)
```
## Character classes and alternatives

There are a number of special patterns that match more than one character. You’ve already seen ., which matches any character apart from a newline. There are four other useful tools:

    \d : matches any digit.
    \s : matches any whitespace (e.g. space, tab, newline).
    [abc] : matches a, b, or c.
    [^abc] : matches anything except a, b, or c.

Remember, to create a regular expression containing \d or \s, you’ll need to escape the \ for the string, so you’ll type "\\d" or "\\s".

A character class containing a single character is a nice alternative to backslash escapes when you want to include a single metacharacter in a regex. Many people find this more readable.
```{r}
# Look for a literal character that normally has special meaning in a regex
x <- c("abc", "a.c", "a*c", "a c")
str_view(x, "a[.]c")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, ".[*]c")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "a[ ]")
```
This works for most (but not all) regex metacharacters: $ . | ? * + ( ) [ {. Unfortunately, a few characters have special meaning even inside a character class and must be handled with backslash escapes: ] \ ^ and -.

You can use alternation to pick between one or more alternative patterns. For example, abc|d..f will match either ‘“abc”’, or “deaf”. Note that the precedence for | is low, so that abc|xyz matches abc or xyz not abcyz or abxyz. Like with mathematical expressions, if precedence ever gets confusing, use parentheses to make it clear what you want:
```{r}
x <- c("grey", "gray")
str_view(x, "gr(e|a)y")
```

### Exercises

Create regular expressions to find all words that:

    Start with a vowel.
    That only contain consonants. (Hint: thinking about matching “not”-vowels.)
    End with ed, but not with eed.
    End with ing or ise.

```{r}
str_subset(stringr::words, "^[aeiou]") #words starting with vowels
str_view(stringr::words, "[aeiou]", match=FALSE) #that only contain consonants
str_subset(stringr::words, "[^e]ed$") #that end with ed, but not eed
str_subset(stringr::words, "i(ng|se)$") #that end with ing or ise
```
## Repetition

The next step up in power involves controlling how many times a pattern matches:

    ?: 0 or 1
    +: 1 or more
    *: 0 or more
```{r}
x <- "1888 is the longest year in Roman numerals: MDCCCLXXXVIII"
str_view(x, "CC?")
```
```{r}

```
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+')
```
Note that the precedence of these operators is high, so you can write: colou?r to match either American or British spellings. That means most uses will need parentheses, like bana(na)+.

You can also specify the number of matches precisely:

    {n}: exactly n
    {n,}: n or more
    {,m}: at most m
    {n,m}: between n and m
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2}")
```
```{r}
str_view(x, "C{2,}")
```
By default these matches are “greedy”: they will match the longest string possible. You can make them “lazy”, matching the shortest string possible by putting a ? after them. This is an advanced feature of regular expressions, but it’s useful to know that it exists:
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C{2,3}?')
```
```{r}
str_view(x, 'C[LX]+?')
```

### Exercise

Describe the equivalents of ?, +, * in {m,n} form.

Pattern 	{m,n} 	Meaning
? 	    {0,1} 	  Match at most 1
+     	{1,}    	Match 1 or more
*     	{0,} 	   Match 0 or more

## Grouping and backreferences

Earlier, you learned about parentheses as a way to disambiguate complex expressions. Parentheses also create a numbered capturing group (number 1, 2 etc.). A capturing group stores the part of the string matched by the part of the regular expression inside the parentheses. You can refer to the same text as previously matched by a capturing group with backreferences, like \1, \2 etc. For example, the following regular expression finds all fruits that have a repeated pair of letters.
```{r}
str_view(fruit, "(..)\\1", match = TRUE)
```
### Exercise
Describe, in words, what these expressions will match:

    (.)\1\1 -- The same character appearing three times in a row (ex: "aaa")
    "(.)(.)\\2\\1" --  A pair of characters followed by the same pair of characters in reversed order (ex" "abba")
    (..)\1 -- Any two characters repeated (ex: "a1a1)
    "(.).\\1.\\1" -- A character followed by any character, the original character, any other character, the original character again (ex: "abaca")
    "(.)(.)(.).*\\3\\2\\1" -- Three characters followed by zero or more characters of any kind followed by the same three characters but in reverse order (ex: "abccba")
    
# Tools

Now that you’ve learned the basics of regular expressions, it’s time to learn how to apply them to real problems. In this section you’ll learn a wide array of stringr functions that let you:

    Determine which strings match a pattern.
    Find the positions of matches.
    Extract the content of matches.
    Replace matches with new values.
    Split a string based on a match.

## Detect matches

Note the below takes advantage of the built in word vector that is loaded with the stringr library.

To determine if a character vector matches a pattern, use str_detect(). It returns a logical vector the same length as the input:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_detect(x, "e")
```
Remember that when you use a logical vector in a numeric context, FALSE becomes 0 and TRUE becomes 1. That makes sum() and mean() useful if you want to answer questions about matches across a larger vector:
```{r}
# How many common words start with t?
sum(str_detect(words, "^t"))
```
```{r}
# What proportion of common words end with a vowel?
mean(str_detect(words, "[aeiou]$"))
```
When you have complex logical conditions (e.g. match a or b but not c unless d) it’s often easier to combine multiple str_detect() calls with logical operators, rather than trying to create a single regular expression. For example, here are two ways to find all words that don’t contain any vowels:
```{r}
# Find all words containing at least one vowel, and negate
no_vowels_1 <- !str_detect(words, "[aeiou]")
```

```{r}
# Find all words consisting only of consonants (non-vowels)
no_vowels_2 <- str_detect(words, "^[^aeiou]+$")
identical(no_vowels_1, no_vowels_2)
```
The results are identical, but I think the first approach is significantly easier to understand. If your regular expression gets overly complicated, try breaking it up into smaller pieces, giving each piece a name, and then combining the pieces with logical operations.

A common use of str_detect() is to select the elements that match a pattern. You can do this with logical subsetting, or the convenient str_subset() wrapper:
```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "x$")] # identify words that end with x 
```
```{r}
str_subset(words, "x$")
```
Typically, however, your strings will be one column of a data frame, and you’ll want to use filter instead:
```{r}
df <- tibble(
  word = words, 
  i = seq_along(word)
)
df %>% 
  filter(str_detect(word, "x$"))
```
A variation on str_detect() is str_count(): rather than a simple yes or no, it tells you how many matches there are in a string:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "banana", "pear")
str_count(x, "a")
```
```{r}
# On average, how many vowels per word?
mean(str_count(words, "[aeiou]"))
```
It’s natural to use str_count() with mutate():
```{r}
df %>% 
  mutate(
    vowels = str_count(word, "[aeiou]"),
    consonants = str_count(word, "[^aeiou]")
  )
```
Note that matches never overlap. For example, in "abababa", how many times will the pattern "aba" match? Regular expressions say two, not three:
```{r}
str_count("abababa", "aba")
```
```{r}
str_view_all("abababa", "aba")
```
Note the use of str_view_all(). As you’ll shortly learn, many stringr functions come in pairs: one function works with a single match, and the other works with all matches. The second function will have the suffix _all.

### Exercise
For each of the following challenges, try solving it by using both a single regular expression, and a combination of multiple str_detect() calls.

    Find all words that start or end with x.
    Find all words that start with a vowel and end with a consonant.
    Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
```{r}
# words that start/end with x
words[str_detect(words, "^x|x$")] # one regex
```

```{r}
# split regex into parts
start_with_x <- str_detect(words, "^x")
end_with_x <- str_detect(words, "x$")
words[start_with_x | end_with_x]
```
```{r}
# words starting with vowel and ending with consonant
str_subset(words, "^[aeiou].*[^aeiou]$") %>% head()
```

```{r}
start_with_vowel <- str_detect(words, "^[aeiou]")
end_with_consonant <- str_detect(words, "[^aeiou]$")
words[start_with_vowel & end_with_consonant] %>% head()
```
Are there any words that contain at least one of each different vowel?
There is not a simple regular expression to match words that that contain at least one of each vowel. The regular expression would need to consider all possible orders in which the vowels could occur.
```{r}
pattern <-
  cross(rerun(5, c("a", "e", "i", "o", "u")),
    .filter = function(...) {
      x <- as.character(unlist(list(...)))
      length(x) != length(unique(x))
    }
  ) %>%
  map_chr(~str_c(unlist(.x), collapse = ".*")) %>%
  str_c(collapse = "|")
```

To check that this pattern works, test it on a pattern that should match
```{r}
str_subset("aseiouds", pattern)
```

Using multiple str_detect() calls, one pattern for each vowel, produces a much simpler and readable answer.
```{r}
str_subset(words, pattern)
```

```{r}
words[str_detect(words, "a") &
  str_detect(words, "e") &
  str_detect(words, "i") &
  str_detect(words, "o") &
  str_detect(words, "u")]
# There appear to be none.
```
## Extract matches

To extract the actual text of a match, use str_extract(). To show that off, we’re going to need a more complicated example. I’m going to use the Harvard sentences, which were designed to test VOIP systems, but are also useful for practicing regexps. These are provided in stringr::sentences:

```{r}
length(sentences)
head(sentences)
```
Imagine we want to find all sentences that contain a colour. We first create a vector of colour names, and then turn it into a single regular expression:
```{r}
colours <- c("red", "orange", "yellow", "green", "blue", "purple")
colour_match <- str_c(colours, collapse = "|")
colour_match
```
Now we can select the sentences that contain a colour, and then extract the colour to figure out which one it is:
```{r}
has_colour <- str_subset(sentences, colour_match)
matches <- str_extract(has_colour, colour_match)
head(matches)
```
The above example has an error.
```{r}
has_colour
```
Can your spot the issue with the regular expression?

Note that str_extract() only extracts the first match. We can see that most easily by first selecting all the sentences that have more than 1 match:
```{r}
more <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more, colour_match)
```
```{r}
str_extract(more, colour_match)
```
This is a common pattern for stringr functions, because working with a single match allows you to use much simpler data structures. To get all matches, use str_extract_all(). It returns a list:
```{r}
str_extract_all(more, colour_match)
```
You’ll learn more about lists in lists and iteration.

If you use simplify = TRUE, str_extract_all() will return a matrix with short matches expanded to the same length as the longest:
```{r}
str_extract_all(more, colour_match, simplify = TRUE)
```
```{r}
x <- c("a", "a b", "a b c")
str_extract_all(x, "[a-z]", simplify = TRUE)
```

### Exercises
In the previous example, you might have noticed that the regular expression matched “flickered”, which is not a colour. Modify the regex to fix the problem.

It matches “flickered” because it matches “red”. The problem is that the previous pattern will match any word with the name of a color inside it. We want to only match colors in which the entire word is the name of the color. We can do this by adding a \b (to indicate a word boundary) before and after the pattern:
```{r}
colour_match2 <- str_c("\\b(", str_c(colours, collapse = "|"), ")\\b")
colour_match2
```

```{r}
more2 <- sentences[str_count(sentences, colour_match) > 1]
str_view_all(more2, colour_match2, match = TRUE)
```
## Grouped matches

Earlier in this chapter we talked about the use of parentheses for clarifying precedence and for backreferences when matching. You can also use parentheses to extract parts of a complex match. For example, imagine we want to extract nouns from the sentences. As a heuristic, we’ll look for any word that comes after “a” or “the”. Defining a “word” in a regular expression is a little tricky, so here I use a simple approximation: a sequence of at least one character that isn’t a space.

```{r}
noun <- "(a|the) ([^ ]+)"

has_noun <- sentences %>%
  str_subset(noun) %>%
  head(10)
has_noun %>% 
  str_extract(noun)
```
str_extract() gives us the complete match; str_match() gives each individual component. Instead of a character vector, it returns a matrix, with one column for the complete match followed by one column for each group:
```{r}
has_noun %>% 
  str_match(noun)
```
(Unsurprisingly, our heuristic for detecting nouns is poor, and also picks up adjectives like smooth and parked.)

If your data is in a tibble, it’s often easier to use tidyr::extract(). It works like str_match() but requires you to name the matches, which are then placed in new columns:
```{r}
tibble(sentence = sentences) %>% 
  tidyr::extract(
    sentence, c("article", "noun"), "(a|the) ([^ ]+)", 
    remove = FALSE
  )
```
Like str_extract(), if you want all matches for each string, you’ll need str_match_all().

### Exercises

Find all words that come after a “number” like “one”, “two”, “three” etc. Pull out both the number and the word.
```{r}
numword <- "\\b(one|two|three|four|five|six|seven|eight|nine|ten) +(\\w+)"
sentences[str_detect(sentences, numword)] %>%
  str_extract(numword)
```

## Replacing matches

str_replace() and str_replace_all() allow you to replace matches with new strings. The simplest use is to replace a pattern with a fixed string:
```{r}
x <- c("apple", "pear", "banana")
str_replace(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```
```{r}
str_replace_all(x, "[aeiou]", "-")
```
With str_replace_all() you can perform multiple replacements by supplying a named vector:
```{r}
x <- c("1 house", "2 cars", "3 people")
str_replace_all(x, c("1" = "one", "2" = "two", "3" = "three"))
```
Instead of replacing with a fixed string you can use backreferences to insert components of the match. In the following code, I flip the order of the second and third words.
```{r}
sentences %>% 
  str_replace("([^ ]+) ([^ ]+) ([^ ]+)", "\\1 \\3 \\2") %>% 
  head(5)
```

### Exercise
Replace all forward slashes in a string with backslashes.
```{r}
str_replace_all("past/present/future", "/", "\\\\")
```

## Splitting

Use str_split() to split a string up into pieces. For example, we could split sentences into words:
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ")
```
Because each component might contain a different number of pieces, this returns a list. If you’re working with a length-1 vector, the easiest thing is to just extract the first element of the list:
```{r}
"a|b|c|d" %>% 
  str_split("\\|") %>% 
  .[[1]]
```
Otherwise, like the other stringr functions that return a list, you can use simplify = TRUE to return a matrix:
```{r}
sentences %>%
  head(5) %>% 
  str_split(" ", simplify = TRUE)
```
You can also request a maximum number of pieces:
```{r}
fields <- c("Name: Hadley", "Country: NZ", "Age: 35")
fields %>% str_split(": ", n = 2, simplify = TRUE)
```
Instead of splitting up strings by patterns, you can also split up by character, line, sentence and word boundary()s:
```{r}
x <- "This is a sentence.  This is another sentence."
str_view_all(x, boundary("word"))
```
```{r}
str_split(x, " ")[[1]]
```
```{r}
str_split(x, boundary("word"))[[1]]
```

### Exercise

Split up a string like “apples, pears, and bananas” into individual components.
```{r}
x <- c("apples, pears, and bananas")
str_split(x, ", +(and +)?")[[1]]
```

# stringi

stringr is built on top of the stringi package. stringr is useful when you’re learning because it exposes a minimal set of functions, which have been carefully picked to handle the most common string manipulation functions. stringi, on the other hand, is designed to be comprehensive. It contains almost every function you might ever need: stringi has 250 functions to stringr’s 49.

If you find yourself struggling to do something in stringr, it’s worth taking a look at stringi. The packages work very similarly, so you should be able to translate your stringr knowledge in a natural way. The main difference is the prefix: str_ vs. stri_.
